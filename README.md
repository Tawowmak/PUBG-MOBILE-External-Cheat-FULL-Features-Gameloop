### Alternative Compilation Method (Using Builder.bat)

As an alternative to manually building the solution through Visual Studio, you can compile the project using the **Builder.bat** script. This method automates the build process.<br>
Double-click on **Builder.bat** to start the build process.<br>
The script will automatically compile the solution and open the output folder.

- Compiled File Location: `./x64/Release/PUBGM Cheat.exe`

## Usage

- You'll need to launch the Android Emulator using the following command in PowerShell. This will open the emulator with the appropriate arguments for the cheat to work.
```batch
powershell -Command "$installPath = (Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Tencent\MobileGamePC\UI' -Name InstallPath).InstallPath; Start-Process -FilePath \"`\"$installPath\\AndroidEmulatorEn.exe`\"\" -ArgumentList '-vm 100'"
```
- After launching the emulator, open the **PUBG Mobile** game as you normally would. Wait for the game to load fully.
- Run the Cheat Software
- Press Login Button

- Enjoy it.

### Notes

- **If the cheat is not working**, it could be due to a change in the game's offsets. To resolve this, you'll need to update the game's offsets manually in the `Offsets.cpp` file. Once updated, recompile the project.
  
- **Important:** After updating the offsets, make sure to **comment out line `3101`** in the `Data.cpp` file using `//`. This ensures the cheat runs smoothly after the offsets update.

- **Recommended:** For better security it is highly recommended to use the cheat with an **external bypass**.

- **KeyAuth System:** The KeyAuth system used in the cheat code has been **disabled**. You can enable it again if needed by adjusting the code.

### Additional Tips

- Ensure that the **Android Emulator** is running with sufficient system resources for optimal performance while using the cheat.
